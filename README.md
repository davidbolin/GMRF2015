# PhD course on Gaussian Markov random fields 

This PhD level course was given at Chalmers University of Technology in 2015. It consisted of 10 lectures and 2 projects and was primarily based on the book "Gaussian Markov Random Fields, Theory and Applications" by Rue and Held. 

### Lecture 1 - Introduction to the course.

### Project 2 -  SPDE models and INLA. 

[project description](/projects/lab2.pdf)

Data: [USdata](/projects/USdata.Rdata) 

[slides](/lectures/Flab2.pdf)

Many of the slides were borrowed from earlier courses on GMRFs and INLA given by Dan Simpson and others. The first project was inspired by a project on GMRFs developed by Finn Lindgren while giving the course on statistical image analysis at Lund University.
